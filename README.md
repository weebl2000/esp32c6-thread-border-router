**⚠️ Early Proof of Concept**

This project is a working proof of concept, not a polished product. I got it 
working on my setup — your mileage may vary, especially depending on your 
network configuration (IPv6 routing, NAT66, VM networking all matter).

**Known limitations to be aware of:**
- Uses the ESP32-C6's internal PCB antenna — RF range is limited, keep it 
  close to both your WiFi router and your Thread devices. I'll try to get
  it working with the external antenna if i find some time
- WiFi and Thread share a single RF path — performance is worse than a 
  dedicated two-chip border router
- Has not been extensively tested beyond the author's own setup

**AI disclosure:** I'm just an enthusiast, not an embedded systems expert. 
This project was built with very heavy assistance from 
Claude Sonnet 4.6, including the firmware patches, troubleshooting, and this
writeup. The AI was essential  — I could not have done this without it. Use 
the code accordingly and please improve on it!

# ESP32-C6 Thread Border Router for Home Assistant

Turn a $5 XIAO ESP32-C6 into a fully functional Thread Border Router that connects Matter/Thread devices (like the IKEA Alpstuga air quality sensor) to Home Assistant — with no additional hardware required.

## What this does

- Runs a **Thread Border Router** on the ESP32-C6's built-in 802.15.4 radio
- Connects to your **WiFi network** (no USB data connection needed — power only)
- Exposes an **OTBR-compatible REST API** on port 8080 so Home Assistant can discover and use it
- Lets you commission and control **Matter over Thread** devices from Home Assistant

## Hardware required

- [Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-Studio-XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5884.html) (~$5-$10)
- USB-C cable for data and power (charge-only cable is fine after flashing)
- A PC/Mac/Linux machine for flashing (one time only)

## Compatibility

Tested with:
- IKEA Alpstuga (Matter over Thread air quality sensor)
- Home Assistant running in a VM (with bridged networking)
- pfsense router (see [Network Notes](#network-notes) for IPv6 requirements)

Should work with any Matter over Thread device.

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant with the **Matter** integration and **Matter Server** add-on installed
- A router that supports IPv6 (required for Thread/Matter)
- **NAT66 must be disabled** on your router — Matter commissioning requires real IPv6 end-to-end connectivity

## Step 1 — Install ESP-IDF

ESP-IDF is Espressif's development framework. You only need to do this once.

### Windows

1. Download and run the [ESP-IDF Windows Installer](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/)
2. During installation, select **ESP32-C6** as the target chip
3. Or clone manually:
   ```cmd
   git clone -b v5.4.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
   cd esp-idf
   install.bat esp32c6
   ```

### Linux / macOS

```bash
git clone -b v5.4.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
./install.sh esp32c6
```

> **Important:** Always use ESP-IDF **v5.4.2** — other versions may conflict with the toolchain.

---

## Step 2 — Set up the environment

Every time you open a new terminal you must activate the ESP-IDF environment first.

### Windows
```cmd
cd path\to\esp-idf
export.bat
```

### Linux / macOS
```bash
cd path/to/esp-idf
. ./export.sh
```

---

## Step 3 — Copy the project files

Navigate to the border router example:

```
cd examples/openthread/ot_br
```

Copy the following files from this repository into the example folder:

| File | Destination |
|------|-------------|
| `partitions_4mb_otbr.csv` | `examples/openthread/ot_br/` |
| `sdkconfig.defaults` | append to `examples/openthread/ot_br/sdkconfig.defaults` |
| `main/esp_ot_br.c` | replace `examples/openthread/ot_br/main/esp_ot_br.c` |

> **For sdkconfig.defaults:** Open the existing file and paste the contents of this repo's `sdkconfig.defaults` at the **bottom**. Do not replace the whole file.

---

## Step 4 — Configure WiFi and target

Set the build target:
```
idf.py set-target esp32c6
```

Open the configuration menu:
```
idf.py menuconfig
```

Navigate to **Example Configuration** and set your WiFi SSID and password.

Also verify:
- `Component config → OpenThread → Thread Core Features → Thread 15.4 Radio Link` → **Native 15.4 radio**
- `Serial flasher config → Flash size` → **4 MB**

Save with **S**, quit with **Q**.

---

## Step 5 — Build and flash

Connect your XIAO ESP32-C6 via USB, then:

### Windows
```cmd
idf.py build flash -p COM11 monitor
```
(replace `COM11` with your actual COM port — check Device Manager)

### Linux / macOS
```bash
idf.py build flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor
```
(replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with your actual port)

The build takes ~10 minutes the first time. After flashing, watch the monitor output. After ~20 seconds you should see the device connect to WiFi and get an IP address.

---

## Step 6 — Verify the REST API

Once connected to WiFi (check your router's DHCP list for the ESP's IP), open these URLs in your browser:

```
http://<ESP_IP>:8080/node
```
Should return: `{"State":4}`

```
http://<ESP_IP>:8080/networks/dataset/active
```
Should return: `{"ActiveDataset":"0e08..."}`

If both work, your border router is ready.

---

## Step 7 — Configure Home Assistant

### Add the Thread network dataset

1. In HA go to **Settings → System → Thread**
2. Your ESP border router should appear — click it and add the Thread dataset from `http://<ESP_IP>:8080/networks/dataset/active`

### Commission your Matter device

1. Install the **Home Assistant Companion app** on your phone
2. Go to **Settings → Companion app → Troubleshooting → Sync Thread credentials**
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Matter**
4. Scan the QR code on your device or enter the setup code (only got it working using the code for now)
5. Follow the prompts — the device will join the Thread network and appear in HA

---

## Network Notes

Thread/Matter requires proper **end-to-end IPv6 connectivity**. Several common network setups need extra configuration:

### NAT66
**Disable NAT66** on your router. Matter commissioning uses direct IPv6 and will fail if packets are being NAT'd.

### Home Assistant in a VM
Make sure the VM uses **bridged networking** (not NAT). The VM must be on the same network segment as the ESP border router.

### Static route for Thread prefix (probably optional)
The ESP advertises the Thread network prefix (eg `fd55:ec6e:b588::/48` by default) via Router Advertisements. If your router blocks or doesn't propagate these, add a static IPv6 route:

- **Destination:** eg `fd55:ec6e:b588::/48` (check your actual prefix from the dataset)
- **Gateway:** ESP's link-local IPv6 address (visible in router's neighbor table)

### pfsense specific
1. Add a static IPv6 gateway pointing to the ESP's link-local address
2. Add a firewall rule on LAN (above the default IPv6 rule) routing eg `fd55:ec6e:b588::/48` via the ESP gateway
3. Disable NAT66

---

## Troubleshooting

### WiFi won't connect
- Check SSID and password in menuconfig
- The onboard antenna is small — keep the ESP within 5m of your router (or closer, same with the thread device!)
- Signal below -85 dBm causes instability with Thread coexistence

### Build fails with "Tool doesn't match supported version"
You have multiple ESP-IDF versions installed. Always open a **fresh terminal** and run `export.bat` / `. ./export.sh` from your **cloned v5.4.2** folder before running any `idf.py` command.

### Build fails with "esp_http_server.h: No such file or directory"
The REST API in `esp_ot_br.c` depends on the `esp_http_server` component. If your ESP-IDF version's `ot_br` example doesn't already require it, add `esp_http_server` to the `REQUIRES` (or `PRIV_REQUIRES`) list in `examples/openthread/ot_br/main/CMakeLists.txt`, then rebuild.

### LAN IPv6 stops working when ESP is powered on
The ESP's border routing manager sends Router Advertisements on WiFi which can conflict with your router. The `suppress_backbone_ra_task` in the firmware handles this automatically after 20 seconds. If you still see issues, check that `otBorderRouterRemoveOnMeshPrefix` is being called successfully in the logs.

### Matter commissioning fails with "PASESession timed out"
- Check that NAT66 is disabled
- Verify the static route to the Thread prefix is in place
- Check firewall rules aren't blocking IPv6 between HA and the Thread prefix
- Make sure HA has a working IPv6 address and default gateway

### "No Thread border router" error during commissioning
- Verify `/node` returns `{"State":4}` — if State is 1, Thread hasn't attached yet, wait 30 seconds and try again
- Do **Settings → Companion app → Troubleshooting → Sync Thread credentials** on your phone before each commissioning attempt

### ESP crashes after ~30 seconds (SW_CPU reset)
This was caused by calling `otBorderRoutingSetEnabled()` too early. Make sure you are using the version of `esp_ot_br.c` from this repository which uses `otBorderRouterRemoveOnMeshPrefix()` instead.

## How it works

The ESP32-C6 contains both a 2.4GHz WiFi radio and an 802.15.4 Thread radio on the same chip, sharing a single RF path. The ESP-IDF `ot_br` example connects these together to form a border router.

On top of the base example, this project adds:

1. **OTBR-compatible REST API** — Home Assistant's Matter integration expects specific endpoints (`/node`, `/networks/dataset/active`) that the base example doesn't provide. We add a minimal HTTP server implementing these endpoints.

2. **RA suppression** — By default the border routing manager floods the WiFi network with Router Advertisements, breaking existing IPv6 setups. We remove the on-mesh prefix after initialization to prevent this.

3. **4MB partition table** — The default partition layout assumes 8MB+ flash. This custom layout fits everything into 4MB by removing OTA and RCP update slots.

---

## Known limitations

- **Single RF path:** WiFi and Thread share one antenna. This reduces throughput compared to a two-chip setup (e.g. ESP32-S3 + ESP32-H2). Fine for sensor polling, not ideal for high-bandwidth devices.
- **No RCP auto-update:** Disabled to save flash space.
- **No web GUI:** Disabled to save flash space.
- **WiFi credentials in NVS:** Stored in flash. The backup `.bin` file contains your credentials — don't share it.

---

## Backup and restore

To back up the full flash (including WiFi credentials and Thread dataset):
```
python -m esptool --chip esp32c6 -p <PORT> read_flash 0x0 0x400000 backup.bin
```

To restore:
```
python -m esptool --chip esp32c6 -p <PORT> write_flash 0x0 backup.bin
```

> Keep your backup `.bin` private — it contains your WiFi password.
